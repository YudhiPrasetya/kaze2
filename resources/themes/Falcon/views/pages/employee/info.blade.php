		<p class="text-nunito text-600">A <strong>employee</strong> is a term for workers and managers working for a company, organization or community. These people are the <strong>staff</strong> of the organization. In general, any person hired by an employer to do a particular job in exchange for payment is an employee, but there are different kinds of employees. In some countries, employers are required by law to do certain things, like obey minimum wage laws, provide a safe workplace, and sometimes pay a tax. Employers also have to give their official employees benefits, like paying for health insurance. Because of this, some employers like to hire independent contractors to do work instead of regular employees. In the United States, a worker is an employee if their employer gets to tell them what do do, how to do it, and when to do it in a material way and an independent contractor if they get to make their own decisions about how to do what the employer wants.<sup class="text-info">[1]</sup><sup class="text-info">[2]</sup></p>
		<p class="text-nunito text-600">The relationship between employer and employee is different from that between the firm and a customer or client.</p>
		<p class="text-nunito text-600">An employee usually has to provide a resume and have an interview before being offered a job.</p>
